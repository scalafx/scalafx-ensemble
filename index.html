        <h3>ScalaFX - Ensemble.</h3>

<p>ScalaFX Ensemble is a project which is inspired from <a href="http://jfxtras.org/">http://jfxtras.org/</a> which is developed in JavaFX. Instead this project is developed in <a href="https://github.com/scalafx/scalafx">ScalaFX</a>. We know that it looks slightly different from the JavaFx Ensemble we are working towards it thus making it as better as possible !!!! </p>

<h3>Update 2019-11-09</h3>
<p>Native installers for Windows, Mac OS, and Unix/Linux are available in ScalaFX Ensemble v.1.14.0.
 Downloads are available on the <a href="https://github.com/scalafx/scalafx-ensemble/releases">Releases</a> page.</p>
        
<h3>Update 2013-10-29</h3>
<p>All of the examples were updated to make best use of current version of ScalaFX (1.0.0-M7-SNAPSHOT). There were also some improvements to the ScalaFX Ensemble application: there is a new button to save an example as a complete SBT project, layout of the application and presentation of examples was improved. Below are some latest screen shots:<p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>We are done with the most of the controls in the ScalaFx (including charts,grapics2d). However all these are bleeding edge releases as we are looking forward for the first level of launch of ScalaFx API. On case to case basis we jump-in to fix any issues in the API itself. Again stay tuned .... </p>
